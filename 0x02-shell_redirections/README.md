# Project Scripts

This project contains two bash scripts that perform the following tasks:

1. `script1.sh`: This script prints "Hello, World!" to the console when executed.

2. `script2.sh`: This script creates a new directory named "new_directory" in the current location when executed.

These scripts are designed to meet the requirements specified in the project guidelines.
